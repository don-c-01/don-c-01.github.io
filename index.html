										<p>Stardate 041720.8 - It's been a long journey.  Five years in the Grove Sea.  In that time, I've learned so much about my profession, but also about life. I've met so many wise, kind people. In fact, I decided to make this logbook to keep a record of the journey in the public domain for I or anyone else to read at any time.  Everyone walks their own path in this life. I hope these entries can offer something that helps some traverse theirs. Below are just a few previews of what I plan to write about.</p>

										<p>Stardate 060519.5 - At the tail end of Fall 2018, I joined the Society of Automotive Engineers.  I met some really cool people and learned a lot about cars.  My first love was the airplane, but everyone in the club has a passion for cars that it flowed to me by osmosis. I learned how internal combustion engines work, as well as the mechanics that go into optimizing race performance</p>

										<p>Stardate 041820.1 - There were many long days and many long nights.  At the start of it all, I thought that engineering was using math to solve problems.  This approach brought me a great deal of stress.  Over time, I came to see that engineering is a field that requires a dialectical approach.  Many factors are considered when trying to solve problems and sometimes these factors contradict each other (e.g. safety & quality vs speed & cost).  It’s more than just plugging values into equations derived decades ago.  It’s using those equations and a variety of other deciding factors like cost, customer needs, laws, etc. to make a judgement call about how something should be designed.  This approach served me well, especially during projects, and I believe they will continue to help me in my career.</p>
